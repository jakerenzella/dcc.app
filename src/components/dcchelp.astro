        <terminal-line>
          In your code, you are using a while loop to iterate over the elements
          of the <span style="color: #be3737">data</span> array. You correctly use
          a condition i is less than 5 to ensure that the loop only runs while i
          is less than 5. However, you forgot to consider the fact that array indices
          start from 0. So, when i becomes 5 in the loop, it is actually trying to
          access the element at index 5, which is out of bounds.

          >The runtime error occurs when you try to print the "Final value"
          using
          <span style="color: #be3737">data[i]</span> after the while loop. At this
          point, i is 5, so it is trying to access <span style="color: #be3737"
            >data[5]</span
          >, which does not exist and leads to undefined behavior.</terminal-line

        <terminal-line
          >To fix this error, you should change the condition in the while loop
          to i less than 5 (to account for the valid indices of the array) and
          move the line <span style="color: #be3737"
            >printf("Final value was: %d\n", data[i]);</span
          > inside the while loop, after i++. This way, it will print the final value
          of <span style="color: #be3737">data[i]</span> while <span
            style="color: #be3737">i</span
          > is still valid.
