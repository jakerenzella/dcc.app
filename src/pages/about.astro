        C runs the world, especially when performance and efficiency are
        essential. C powers many operating systems such as Windows (1.4 billion
        active devices) and Android and iOS Kernels (5 billion active machines).
        Many things we use in our daily lives are programmed in C, such as
        coffee machines, microwaves, cars, and 3D movies. However, current
        literature indicates that there is a decline in teaching C as the first
        programming language, whereas it used to be the dominant language. In
        the Group of Eight (Australia's 8 most research-intensive universities),
        The University of New South Wales, Sydney is the only university still
        teaching C as the introductory language.

        The Debugging C/C++ Compiler was created by Dr Andrew Taylor to support
        introductory programming in C for students at the University of New
        South Wales, Sydney. DCC, used over 5 million times, explains the C
        programming language's most common errors and assists students in
        catching bugs. As such, it allows UNSW to continue to use C in
        introduction to programming courses.
