abstract: "This paper introduces a method for Large Language Models (LLM) to produce enhanced compiler error explanations, in simple language, within our Debugging C Compiler (DCC). It is well documented that compiler error messages have been known to present a barrier for novices learning how to program. Although our initial use of DCC in introductory programming (CS1) has been instrumental in teaching C to novice programmers by providing safeguards to commonly occurring errors and translating the usually cryptic compiler error messages at both compile- and run-time, we proposed that incorporating LLM-generated explanations would further enhance the learning experience for novice programmers. Through an expert evaluation, we observed that LLM-generated explanations for compiler errors were conceptually accurate in 90% of compile-time errors, and 75% of run-time errors. Additionally, the new DCC-help tool has been increasingly adopted by students, with an average of 1047 unique runs per week, demonstrating a promising initial assessment of using LLMs to complement compiler output to enhance programming education for beginners. We release our tool as open-source to the community."
