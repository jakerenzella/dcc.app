abstract: "This paper investigates supervised fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) to improve their pedagogical alignment in computing education, addressing concerns that LLMs may hinder learning outcomes. The project utilised a proprietary dataset of 2,500 high quality question/answer pairs from programming course forums, and explores two research questions: the suitability of university course forums in contributing to fine-tuning datasets, and how supervised fine-tuning can improve LLMsâ€™ alignment with educational principles such as constructivism. Initial findings suggest benefits in pedagogical alignment of LLMs, with deeper evaluations required."
