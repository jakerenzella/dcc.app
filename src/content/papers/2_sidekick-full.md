abstract: "This paper introduces DCC Sidekick, a web-based conversational AI tool that enhances an existing LLM-powered C/C++ compiler by generating educational programming error explanations. The tool seamlessly combines code display, compile- and run-time error messages, and stack frame read-outs alongside an AI interface, leveraging compiler error context for improved explanations. We analyse usage data from a large Australian CS1 course, where 959 students engaged in 11,222 DCC Sidekick sessions, resulting in 17,982 error explanations over seven weeks. Notably, over 50% of interactions occurred outside business hours, underscoring the tool's value as an always-available resource. Our findings reveal strong adoption of AI-assisted debugging tools, demonstrating their scalability in supporting extensive CS1 courses. We provide implementation insights and recommendations for educators seeking to incorporate AI tools with appropriate pedagogical safeguards."
