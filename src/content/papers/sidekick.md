abstract: "Students in introductory computing courses often lack the experi-
ence and knowledge to help them effectively identify and resolve
errors in their code. Programming Error Messages (PEMs) can be a
valuable source of information and guidance for novices, as these
messages are often the first indication of an issue during debugging.
However, in many cases, such as with standard C compiler imple-
mentations, PEMs are largely not suitable for novices. Confusing,
often misleading, and filled with terse language and jargon, these
messages instead act as an additional source of difficulty and stress,
particularly for novices.
In this paper, we present DCC Sidekick, which integrates the
Debugging C Compiler (DCC) with a Large Language Model (LLM)
in a web-based dashboard to produce contextual, accurate guidance
conducive to student learning. This dashboard is directly accessible
from the output of the compiler, and provides a birdâ€™s-eye-view of
program source, compiler output, and a conversational AI interface
to help unravel cryptic error messages. We aim to deploy DCC
Sidekick to a C-based CS1 cohort at a large higher education insti-
tution to investigate how novice students utilise the conversational
explanation interface during debugging activities. In this work, we
present our experience designing and building DCC Sidekick."
